### .NET Framework 4.6.2

This release of AppVeyor requires .NET Framework 4.6.2 installed on the server. If server's OS is Windows Server 2016 or 2019 then you are good.
Otherwise, please install [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53344) before performing AppVeyor upgrade.

### New Host Agent

If you are running builds in processes, Hyper-V VMs or Docker containers then the latest version of AppVeyor Host Agent must be installed. Please uninstall existing AppVeyor Host Agent first as upgrade with installer might cause issues.
